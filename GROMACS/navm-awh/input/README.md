Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the initiation of action potentials.
Their malfunction results in excitability disorders such as arrhythmias. Understanding the
relationship between their structure and function is important to develop pharmacological agents.
Capturing the structure of the open state of these channels is challenging because these channels
inactivate spontaneously. Here we have used molecular simulations to show that a structure that
was thought to be open is in fact impermeable to ions, and that an open state can be produced by
a conformational transition that involves a change in the secondary structure of the pore-lining
helices. This work produces an experimentally testable model that could be useful for further
mechanistic and drug development studies.
